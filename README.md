This is a personal project of a telegram bot that tracks your Kucoin portfolio. Upon /start you are greeted with a message that further tells you the bots functionality and suggests running the /help command. Once chat is initiated, you can then set a threshold using the /set <number between 0-100> command which the bot will then set. If any of your trades fall below or go above this threshold, you will be sent a notification listing the winning/losing trades. The functionality is not perfect but it's still in progress.
